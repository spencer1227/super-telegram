# The Project
As a developer for Horiseon I was tasked with updating our digital website with the following requirements:

Acceptance Criteria:
- Webpage meets accessibility standards
- Semantic HTML elements are used
- The elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- Accessible alt attributes
- Attributes fall in sequential order
- Title is concise & descriptive

Additional Requirements
- Ensure all links function correctly
- Consolidate & clean up CSS files for efficency
- Keep properties in order to function properly

# Completing the Project

To complete this project, the first step was utilizing Semantic HTML, which is not being used in the HTML.

Semantic HTML updates includes the following:
- Header
- Nav (Navigation)
- Section
- Article
- Aside
- Footer

Other updates made to the HTML include adding alt property
Once the specific areas were identified, changes were made from div to their correct Semantic HTML format. This will help 

For the CSS file, several of the elements that were being changed made were being written exactly the same. This was fixed by copying the element and adding a comma to seperate the elements being changed. Condensing the CSS file will make the progran run smoother.
